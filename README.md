# DecisionTree

We create a simple tree to create our criteria for clusters.

The clusters are created automatically, we made a simple decision about k, and the ROCurve gets added later.

Steps:
 1.  - create a basic tree algorithm
 2.  - Test it using it in a normal  R environment, preferably RStudio
 3.  - Abstract and convert it into a function
 4.  - Use the function in other projects
 5.  - TWeak and revise
